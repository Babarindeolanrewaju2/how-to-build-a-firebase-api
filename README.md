# how-to-build-a-firebase-api

This repo accompanies my blog post on [rhythmandbinary.com here](https://rhythmandbinary.com/2019/07/24/building-an-api-with-firebase/)

The `functions` folder holds the backend API endpoints.

The `frontend` folder holds a basic Angular frontend application that consumes the API endpoints.

The `postman` folder holds a postman collection that has example calls that you can run.  Within the collection the `localhost` are calls when running the functions locally, and `deployed` are calls when running the functions deployed.
